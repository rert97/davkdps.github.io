<h1> How to Protect yourself against hackers </h1>
<div class="font">
<img src="hack-key.jpg">
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> There is nothing, hardware or software, that is unhackable. </p>
<p>Let's get that out of the way right off the bat. If a hacker - a real hacker, not someone with a set of easily available hacking tools - really wants your information, they will get it. The same can be said for the NSA or any other state-sponsored organization.
</p>
<h2> Passwords and Password Managers </h2>
<p>
A strong password is a good first step to securing your data. But you need to do more than just use a combination of letters and symbols. To reduce the chances of having your password guessed or brute forced, use a password manager and use a randomly generated alpha-numeric password that's at least 20 characters long. LastPass, Dashlane, RoboForm, mSecure and 1Password  are cross platform services that work via the mobile Web in addition to native apps.
</p>
<h2>Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>Two-factor authentication acts as stop-gap when a new device tries to log into a service or site. For example, with Twitter's two-factor authentication feature enabled, when you try to log into your account with a new device, it sends you a text message with a temporary password. In other words, you can't log into an account without your phone and the temporary password sent to that phone.</p>

<h2>    Security Questions   </h2>
<p> At some point these made sense. Probably before social networks had us sharing all our personal information with friends, family and then eventually the world. Now security questions like "What's your mom's maiden name?" and "What's the name of your favorite movie?" are easy to answer by anyone that knows how to use Google, since we've shared most of that information online. Instead of answering truthfully, come up with unique answers that make zero sense in context. For example: "What's your favorite food?" could be answered with Buster Table.
<strong> Make sure it's something memorable that has nothing to do with the actual question.</strong>
</p>

<h2>    Misinformation </h2>
<p>Since you're already going to start answering questions with lies, you might as well make your online persona a den of fabrications in the name of security. "A lot of times people are disillusioned and feel resistance is impossible and they just give up,‚Äù Sell said while talking about people already in the thick of social networking, "the most powerful tool going forward is misinformation." She recommends changing all the key things that are used by companies as security questions. This includes your birthday, billing address, birth location, and family ties.</p>
<p>
Birthdates can prove to be a huge security risk. Just move your birthday on Facebook a few days forward or back and maybe even change the year or you can hide it. Most people won't even notice and for those that do, just tell them why and suggest they do the same.
