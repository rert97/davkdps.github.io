	<img src="ph.jpg" class="img-m" /><strong><p>Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and money) , often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication</strong>. The word is a neologism created as a homophone of fishing due to the similarity of using a bait in an attempt to catch a victim. </p>

	<p> Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website, the look and feel of which are identical to the legitimate one and the only difference is the URL of the website in concern. Communications purporting to be from social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators are often used to lure victims. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware.
	</p>

<h2> Types of phishing </h2>
<ol type="I">
<li>	Spear phishing </li>
<p> Phishing attempts directed at specific individuals or companies have been termed spear phishing. </p>
<li>	Clone phishing </li>
<p>	Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email.
</p>
<li>Whaling</li>
<p>	Several phishing attacks have been directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets within businesses, and the term whaling has been coined for these kinds of attacks. In the case of whaling, the masquerading web page/email will take a more serious executive-level form. The content will be crafted to target an upper manager and the person's role in the company. The content of a whaling attack email is often written as a legal subpoena, customer complaint, or executive issue. Whaling scam emails are designed to masquerade as a critical business email, sent from a legitimate business authority. </p>
<li>	Link manipulation </li>
<p> Most methods of phishing use some form of technical deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed website it leads to) appear to belong to the spoofed organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of subdomains are common tricks used by phishers
</p>
<li>	Filter evasion </li>
<p> Phishers have even started using images instead of text to make it harder for anti-phishing filters to detect text commonly used in phishing emails. However, this has led to the evolution of more sophisticated anti-phishing filters that are able to recover hidden text in images. These filters use OCR (optical character recognition) to optically scan the image and filter it
</p>

<li> Covert redirect </li>
<p> Covert redirect is a subtle method to perform phishing attacks that makes links appear legitimate, but actually redirect a victim to an attacker's website. The flaw is usually masqueraded under a log-in popup based on an affected site's domain.
</p>
<li>	Social engineering	</li>
<p>	Users can be encouraged to click on various kinds of unexpected content for a variety of technical and social reasons. For example, a malicious attachment might masquerade as a benign linked Google doc.
</p>
<li> Phone phishing </li>
<p> Not all phishing attacks require a fake website. Messages that claimed to be from a bank told users to dial a phone number regarding problems with their bank accounts. Once the phone number (owned by the phisher, and provided by a voice over IP service) was dialed, prompts told users to enter their account numbers and PIN. </p>
</ol>
<h2> How to avoid Phishing </h2>
<img src="Phish.jpg" class="pp">
<p>There are anti-phishing websites which publish exact messages that have been recently circulating the internet, such as FraudWatch International and Millersmiles. Such sites often provide specific details about the particular messages. To avoid directly dealing with the source code of web pages, hackers are increasingly using a phishing tool called Super Phisher that makes the work easy when compared to manual methods of creating phishing websites.
<h3>Social responses</h3>
<p>One strategy for combating phishing is to train people to recognize phishing attempts, and to deal with them. Education can be effective, especially where training emphasises conceptual knowledge
<h3>Browsers alerting users to fraudulent websites</h3>
<p>An other popular approach to fighting phishing is to maintain a list of known phishing sites and to check websites against the list. Microsoft's IE7 browser, Mozilla Firefox 2.0, Safari 3.2, and Opera all contain this type of anti-phishing measure
